## Project Requirements
_This portion of the README is due March 8th (see the project handout)!_

Our project came out of a conversation with an owner of a local coffee shop. He said that he had noticed that the weather and other local events impacted his number of customers and sales, but was curious how significantly these factors affected total sales and the sales of specific items. The owner also expressed that it was difficult to consider all these external factors when making business decisions. Specifically, he described that it was difficult for him to keep an efficient inventory, determine the number of workers he needed, and manage other important logistics.  We think that this is a problem that many coffee shops and other small restaurants face, and we think providing a solution to this problem will be much appreciated by many owners. 

To solve this problem, we will be designing a web app that will read sales information from Square, a platform ubiquitously used by cafes. Then we will use the Square data along with other data to predict sales trends. Specifically, we want to look at how total sales, as well as sales of particular items, change depending on the weather, whether or not it is a holiday, and numerous other variables. One particularly interesting variable we are considering for coffee shops in college towns is how busy the college academic calendar is. We imagine that this has a significant impact on the business of cafes. This idea of using college academic calendars to project sales for college town coffee shops can be applied to using other local calendars for cafes in a local communities. 

Here are some features we are think about including:

Login/Signup Page - When you sign up you also authenticate through Square, which allows our app to access the sales data.

Home dashboard - A home page that displays the current weather, any special events that are occurring today, and any trends that can be determined from these variables. For example, “It is 72 degrees and sunny outside, so expect to sell more cold beverages than usual. Brown students are on break right now, so the number of customers will probably be lower.” Using our statistical analysis, specific values can be calculated for how much more/less of each item will be sold, as well as how sales will drop depending on the calendar information given. Users will have the option to extend the forecast to weekly and monthly views as well.

Additional pages that have more detailed information/statistical analysis.


Potential factors to consider in our analytics:

Including weather data to predict sales

Including outside calendars - this is especially relevant for coffee shops in college towns. Store owners can significantly cut down on their inventory when students go off for Spring or Winter break, for example, because their predictions present a decrease in sales. However, even community calendars will aid coffee shops in predicting sales. Coffee shops can expect more foot traffic, more families/friends out and about when it's a holiday vs. a regular Monday. This was something the coffee shop owner we spoke with also mentioned. He said knowing when students are on campus is invaluable. 

Other potential factors could include holidays, culture trends, and/or political trends.
